# Collection of Blender Addons for Molecular Structures

## Dependencies
* ASE: You just need to find the location of your blender installation and use pip to install ase for blender to find it. For example when installed with snap:

  `/snap/blender/xxxx/3.x/python/bin/python3.x -m pip install ase`


## Usage
To use the addons in Blender simply go to edit -> preferences -> addons; click install; find these addons, install them, than activate them in the list.

You can now import molecules from the File -> import tab and use render -> render vpts to render all collections seperately for your list of cameras.

Images will be put in the folder with the collection name and the name of the camera (name them top, side, front. camera.001 and camera.002 won't help you understand it).
